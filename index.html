            <h3>Food for a family</h3>
            <p>
              Family meals provide an opportunity for family members to come
              together, strengthen ties and build better relationships. They
              build a sense of belonging which leads to better self-esteem.
              Family meals offer parents a chance to be role models. They can
              set an example of healthy eating and polite table manners.

            <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
            <p>
              Shelters provide essential aspects of protection, services and
              resources which enable women who have experienced abuse and their
              children to recover from the violence, to rebuild self-esteem, and
              to take steps to regain a self-determined and independent life.

            <h3>Education for a child</h3>
            <p>
              Education brings self-discipline, a sense of responsibility,
              team-work among children and prevents them from feeling social
              insecurity. It helps in being self-confident and a good
              decision-maker. Hence, every child must be educated so that they
              can lead a happy
